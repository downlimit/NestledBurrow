## Temporary room art

The current wooden floor, horizontal walls, vertical walls, and corner tiles are deterministic 16×16 Phaser-generated placeholder textures defined in `src/main.js`. They do not use external files or carry a third-party license. This replaced the previously selected Kenney room spritesheet after the chosen frame indexes produced unrelated props instead of valid room tiles.
